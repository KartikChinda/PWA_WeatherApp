Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that use service workers, manifests, and other web-platform features in combination with progressive enhancement to give users an experience on par with native apps.

PWAs provide a number of advantages to users â€” including being installable, progressively enhanced, responsively designed, re-engageable, linkable, discoverable, network independent, and secure.
